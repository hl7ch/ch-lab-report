# Examples implemented as bundles
The Implementation Guide contains no explicitly linked examples for this profile

# Caused by the underlying profile CHCorePatient INFO
The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)


# Caused by underlying profiles, parameter pin-canonicals can not be set because can't be build any more
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-uncertainty'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '5.2.0', found versions: 1.0.0, 4.0.1, 5.1.0, 5.2.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-uncertainty' to 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-uncertainty|5.2.0'
